     <p><b>Charles Edward</b> (1884â€“1954) was at various times a <u>British prince</u>, the last ruling duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in<i> Germany</i>, and a Nazi politician. Brought up in the United Kingdom, he was selected to succeed to the throne of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1899 because he was deemed young enough to be re-educated as a German. He married Princess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein and the couple had five children. Charles Edward was a conservative ruler with an interest in art and technology. During the First World War, he supported the German Empire but was deposed during the German Revolution. During the 1920s, Charles Edward became a moral and financial supporter of violent far-right paramilitary groups, joining the Nazi Party in 1933. He was given multiple positions, including leader of the German Red Cross, and acted as an unofficial diplomat. After the war, he was interned for a period and given a minor conviction by a denazification court, dying of cancer in 1954.</p>
